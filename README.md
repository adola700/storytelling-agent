### Agent Roles

| Agent | Type | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| **Narrator** | Main session | Orchestrates the story, narrates episodes, manages memory |
| **Director** | Spawned sub-agent | Plans scenes — setting, beats, emotional arc, hooks |
| **Actor** | Spawned sub-agent | Generates in-character dialogue and actions |

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v22+
- **OpenClaw** installed globally: `npm install -g openclaw`
- **Telegram Bot** created via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) — save the bot token
- **Telegram User ID** — get it from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
- **OpenAI API Key** (GPT-5.1) — already configured in `openclaw.json`

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Enter

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd storytelling-agent
```

### 2. Install OpenClaw

```bash
npm install -g openclaw
```

### 3. Run Onboarding

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

During onboarding:
- Select **Telegram** as your channel
- Enter your **Telegram Bot Token** (from @BotFather)
- Enter your **Telegram User ID** (from @userinfobot)
- When asked about workspace, point to the `./workspace` directory in this repo

### 4. Copy Configuration

Copy the provided `openclaw.json` to your OpenClaw config directory:

```bash
cp openclaw.json ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

> **Note**: If you already have an `openclaw.json`, merge the settings manually. The key settings are the `cron` job for heartbeat and the `agents.defaults` for sub-agent support.

### 5. Start the Gateway

```bash
openclaw gateway
```

### 6. Chat on Telegram

Open your Telegram bot and send a story prompt:

> *"Give me a story of a lonely island with peacocks as the only animal on it and someone trapped."*

The Narrator will orchestrate Director + Actor agents behind the scenes and deliver a beautifully narrated episode.

## Usage

### Start a Story
Send any story premise. The Narrator will create Episode 1.

### Continue
Say "continue", "next", or ask what happens next. A new episode is created.

### Refine / Rewrite
Say "rewrite", "change", or give feedback on the current episode. The Narrator rewrites it.

### Guide the Story
Say things like *"I want more mystery"* or *"make the protagonist braver"*. The Narrator records this in memory and follows it in future episodes.

### Idle Nudge
If you're inactive for 3+ minutes during an active story, the Narrator sends a gentle nudge asking if you'd like to continue.
