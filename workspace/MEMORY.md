## Character Roster
- **Heinrich Vogt** — Solitary watchmaker, 60s, gray-templed, obsessively precise. Widower (wife's lavender still haunts the workshop). Carries guilt over a specific tragic moment 3 years ago (October 14th). Deeply isolated; craft is his only anchor.

## Episode Log
- **Episode 1 — "The Backward Hand":** Heinrich performs his evening ritual in his oil-lamp workshop during October rain. Discovers a clock he doesn't remember making — its hands move counterclockwise, defying all mechanical law. Dismantles it; finds an incomprehensible mechanism. By nightfall he's holding it to his chest, thinking of the one moment he'd undo. Ends on the threshold of decision.

## Open Threads
- The mystery clock: unmarked pewter case, unreadable maker's stamp, impossible mechanism — Heinrich did not make it. Origin unknown.
- The tragedy 3 years ago, October 14th: not yet named. A sealed letter in his drawer, never sent. A photograph kept face-down on the shelf.
- Heinrich's temptation: rewind that specific moment. Consequences unknown but implied to be catastrophic (town begins to unravel).
- The clock is warm to the touch — as if alive.
