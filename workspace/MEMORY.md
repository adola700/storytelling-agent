# Story Memory

## Active Story
- **Status**: Active
- **Episode Count**: 3
- **Title**: The Waterline
- **Genre**: Noir detective / climate catastrophe / temporal mystery
- **Setting**: Flooded London, ~6 months post-flood. 1940s noir aesthetic. Big Ben frozen at 3:47.

## Character Roster
- **DI Vera Blackwood** — Hardened detective, refused to evacuate. Bloomsbury townhouse, 3rd floor. Boat: "The Consequence." Dies in week 3 every loop. Future-Vera's notebook says kill Catherine to break loop. Touched the carved initials in the crypt — may have destabilized the loop.
- **Catherine Morse** — Trapped in 6-month time loop, retains memory across 17 resets. Appears as on evacuation day (dry, unchanged). Desperately trying to save Vera. Exhausted by repetition.

## Episode Log
- **Ep 1 — "The Waterline"**: Vera finds green bottle with impossible photo of Catherine drowning in Vera's office + note: "It already happened. —CM." Spots duplicate notebook in water.
- **Ep 2 — "Seventeen"**: Catherine reveals 6-month time loop broken at 3:47. Shows photo of Vera dead in week 3. Hands over future-Vera's notebook saying Vera must kill Catherine to break the loop.
- **Ep 3 — "The Crypt"**: Vera and Catherine descend to St. Paul's crypt. Vera finds her own initials carved in stone (oxidation dates to 1947). Central chamber: frozen moment (suspended water, newspaper from flood day, Catherine's scarf). Big Ben chimes at 3:47 daily. 17 tally marks. Vera discovers her own corpse from a previous loop. Catherine explains the paradox: killing her creates the cycle. Then — the frozen moment MOVES for the first time in 17 loops. A droplet falls. Something Vera did (touching the carved initials?) destabilized it.

## Open Threads
- The frozen moment moved — what did Vera change? Hope or catastrophe?
- The carved initials dated 1947 — temporal reach beyond the flood?
- The paradox: killing Catherine creates the cycle that demands killing Catherine
- Is there a third option beyond kill/don't kill?
- Why is Catherine the loop's memory anchor?
- The Stayers — echoes of previous iterations?
- Vera's week-3 death — can this loop's deviation prevent it?
