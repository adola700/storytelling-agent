# Episode 1: The Grammar of Drowning

The sea gave her back at dawn, the way it always gives things back — quietly, without apology, depositing her on a shelf of black sand like a letter it had decided not to send.

She did not know, at first, that she was alive. She was only aware of salt, of the vast flat pressure of sky against her cheek, of something that was not quite breathing and not quite drowning. Then her body made a choice on her behalf and she coughed until the choice felt real.

Her name was Dael. She knew this with the certainty of someone who had rehearsed it in the dark — in the hold, in the water, in the time between the wave and the impact. *Dael. Dael. Dael.* She had said it like a spell, as if names were things you could tie around your waist and use to float.

She sat up.

The island rose before her in a green that did not look right. Too deep, too considered — the green of old tapestries, of stained glass, of a color held so long in one place that it had grown into itself and become something else. Black-sand beach curved on both sides, and then the trees began, and the trees went up.

They were not like the trees she knew. They were taller, more deliberate, the trunks pale as birch but the texture of pressed linen, the branches arranged with a precision that suggested architecture rather than growth. They leaned slightly inward at their tops, the way women lean together over a table, sharing a secret, unconcerned with who might overhear.

She became aware of the sound only gradually, the way you become aware of your own heartbeat — already there, always there, noticed now only because you looked for it.

The trees were talking.

Not in the manner of wind through leaves, not the statistical coincidence of branch-creak and bird-call that the mind assembles into pattern. *Talking.* Voices. More than one, layered on each other like the pages of a very old book, each page translucent, each sentence visible through the one above it.

She understood them.

This was the wrong thing. She knew it was the wrong thing the moment it happened, the way you know a dream has gone wrong even before anything bad occurs — some quality of the air, some loosening of the grammar. She had never studied dead languages. She had not studied much of anything except navigation and knots and the way a hull sounds when it loves the water versus the way it sounds when it has begun to dread it. But the words arrived in her head already translated, already warm, as if they had been waiting there in storage.

*She has come,* said one tree.

*Wet,* said another, with what could only be described as resignation.

*They always come wet,* said a third, and the grove shivered in what was not wind.

Dael pressed her palms into the black sand and tried to locate the rational explanation. Shock. Hypothermia. The pressure of the hull on her skull during the moment of impact. She inventoried these possibilities with the careful thoroughness of a woman who had always preferred the sensible answer and had occasionally been made to look foolish for it.

The trees continued.

*She can hear us,* said the first voice, and now there was something different in it — something that was not surprise, exactly, but the older cousin of surprise. Recognition, perhaps. The satisfaction of a prophecy confirming itself.

*Of course,* said the second. *Look at her hands.*

Dael looked at her hands. They were salt-pale, trembling, ordinary. There was a cut along her left palm where the rope had parted. She had no idea what the trees were seeing.

*Will she stay?* asked a voice from farther up the slope, from the deeper part of the grove where the pale trunks crowded close enough to obscure the light. *The others didn't stay.*

A silence. Long, deliberate, the silence of an entire forest considering a question.

*She stayed long enough to listen,* said the first tree, finally. *That's different.*

Dael stood. Her legs worked, barely, the way legs work when the body has been through something it has not yet catalogued. She faced the tree line. The grove looked back at her with the patient attention of something that had been waiting across centuries and had learned, in that time, to be comfortable with waiting.

She thought about the ship. About the other passengers. About the route she had memorized, the stars she had been reading, the impossible and ordinary succession of events that had put her in the water.

She thought: I am alone and my hands are cut and the trees are speaking a language that has been dead for a thousand years and I understand every word.

Then she thought: *Good. Then they can answer questions.*

She took one step toward the trees, and the grove leaned down to meet her.
