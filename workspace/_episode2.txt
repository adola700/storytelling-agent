**Episode 2: Burnham at 00:47**

Burnham Station looked like it had been poured out of a mold made for sleepless men—slick concrete, hard light, and a clock that hung above the platform like a judge who never blinked. Rain hung in the air without falling, a wet breath caught in the throat of the city. The halogen lamps made every puddle a little mirror, and in them Ray Calder saw himself coming: a dark coat, a fedora brim dripping, a cigarette ember fighting the damp.

The notebook rode his ribs like a second heart.

00:40, the clock said. A polite lie. Time in Los Angeles always wore makeup.

Ray moved the way he’d learned to move in alleys and courtrooms—deliberate, shoulders ready to take a hit, eyes doing the work his heart couldn’t afford. The platform was thin with bodies: a couple of men pretending not to watch, a cleaning crew that kept their heads down, and a young woman by the bench with earbuds dangling like she was tethered to another world. Her gaze flicked to Ray and away, as if trouble was something you could catch.

Then he saw the cluster that didn’t belong.

Mayor Devlin, without a podium, was smaller than the city’s papers made him. No flashbulbs, no handshakes—just a dark overcoat, a smile worn on a tight spring, and a trio of aides hovering like nervous moths. Beside him, the man who made the smile possible: Ruiz. Broad shoulders, clipped posture, eyes calibrated to danger. He stood in the space between Devlin and the rest of the world the way a door stood between a room and a fire.

Ray angled toward them.

The cigarette smoke curled out of his mouth slow, a question he didn’t have to ask.

“Mayor Devlin,” he said, and kept it simple. Names, in this town, were often the only honest things.

Devlin’s eyes landed on him—cataloging, calculating—and the smile thinned into something that could cut. “Ray,” he replied, like they’d run into each other at church instead of midnight under a dying clock.

Ruiz stepped forward before the space could close. Palms open, voice clipped, the implied shape of a holster beneath his coat. “Detective. This area’s restricted. You need to move along.”

Ray let the silence stretch just long enough for it to become a statement. “Funny. I didn’t see the fence. Or the sign. Or the reason the Mayor’s taking a midnight stroll where the city’s bones run on steel.”

Devlin’s ring finger twitched once against his pocket, quick as a lie. He kept his chin level. “Coincidences happen in public places,” he said. “But they don’t usually wear badges.”

Ray’s mouth found a skeptical sneer and wore it like armor. “Then let’s call this a civic service. What are you doing here at this hour?”

The overpass clock ticked. The second hand scratched the air.

00:42.

The notebook pressed against Ray’s ribs, asking. He didn’t pull it out yet. He’d learned that power didn’t like surprises unless it was the one giving them.

A distant train horn sounded.

Then another.

Too close. Too matched.

Ray’s eyes shifted to the tracks. Wet rails gleamed like knives laid out in a row. On the far end of the platform, the young woman’s music stopped mid-beat—earbud slipping free—and she looked up with the kind of attention people saved for car crashes.

The station’s PA crackled.

A voice tried to be calm and failed. “—two trains… simultaneous arrival… please stand clear—”

The syllables stuttered and hung, as if the wires didn’t quite believe what they were saying.

Lights appeared down both lines at once.

Two white blooms in the rain-hazed distance, advancing with the steady confidence of schedules and steel.

Devlin’s composure held, but something behind it shifted. A micro-breath. A tightening at the corner of the mouth. Ruiz’s stance widened like a man bracing for impact.

Ray’s fingers slid into his coat.

Leather. Cold.

He pulled the notebook out just enough for the lamplight to catch the edge of the page.

The young woman—Mira, he realized later he’d heard someone call her when she bumped an elbow—blurted, half to herself, half to the world: “That timestamp… it’s wet.”

Ray didn’t turn. He didn’t have to. He felt the heat of attention land on the notebook like a hand.

Ruiz moved to block, forearm angling toward Ray’s chest. “You don’t show that—” he started.

But the page was already breathing.

The ink had a sheen to it, not dry and dead like most writing, but gummy, alive. The paper—God help him—seemed to carry the faintest warmth, as if it had just come out of someone’s pocket. A thin metallic scent rose off it, pennies and electricity.

Devlin’s eyes dropped.

For the first time, the Mayor of Los Angeles looked like a man who’d seen a ghost and realized the ghost had receipts.

00:46.

A high electronic hum thickened under the station’s usual noises. The lamps flickered once, twice—thinking about going out. Devlin glanced at his wrist, reflexive, like the watch could talk him down.

The seconds hand juddered.

Stopped.

Ruiz’s jaw tightened. His hand hovered near his holster, unsure whether the threat was a man, a book, or the air itself.

00:47.

The overhead wiring spat blue sparks in a sudden, vicious shower. For an instant the platform went black, and Ray’s body remembered every alley he’d ever walked and every gun he’d ever heard cock.

Then the lights came back—weak, trembling—just in time to catch both trains screaming into their emergency brakes. Steel shrieked. People shouted. Somebody dropped a bag, the sound small beneath the monstrous cry of slowing momentum.

Devlin staggered as if struck, one hand flying to his temple. When he spoke, it wasn’t to the aides, or Ruiz, or Ray.

It was to the air.

“Tommy,” he murmured, broken on the edge of a name, “the mark—”

Ray’s cigarette went out between his fingers.

He stared at Devlin, at the way that phrase—Tommy, the mark—fit in Devlin’s mouth like it had always belonged there. Like it wasn’t the first time it had been spoken.

Mira took a step forward, eyes wide, fear and curiosity wrestling in her throat. “What the hell is that notebook doing?” she whispered.

Ray didn’t answer. He couldn’t. The notebook answered for him.

Under the lamplight, the last line on the page flushed darker, as if fresh ink were seeping up through the paper from somewhere beneath the world.

00:47 — and then, slowly, new letters began to form in Tommy Mercer’s slanted hand.

Ruiz dragged Devlin down behind the bench, barking into his radio. Ray lunged toward the platform edge, boots skidding on wet concrete, eyes searching the track for something fallen—something burning—something that shouldn’t be there.

The two trains screamed and shuddered, noses nearing the platform like beasts forced to kneel.

And in Ray’s pocket, time—messy, alive, and cruel—kept writing.
