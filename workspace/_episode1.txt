**Episode 1: The Dead Man’s Margins**

Los Angeles wore the rain the way a prizefighter wore bruises—like it had earned them. Neon bled down the glass of Raymond Calder’s window in thin, guilty stripes, broken by venetian blinds that never quite closed, never quite told the whole truth. Somewhere below, tires hissed through puddles and vanished. Up here, the city’s noise arrived muffled, respectful, like it knew there was a body in the story.

Ray stood in his doorway with the coroner’s voice still scratching at the inside of his skull.

Approximate.

Time of death: approximate.

There were a lot of things the world let you approximate. The price of a sandwich. The loyalty of a politician. How long you could go without sleep before you started seeing what you wanted to see. But not that. Not him.

The chair near the desk was on its side—thrown there earlier when Ray discovered he couldn’t sit down without hearing the absence beside him. A cup of coffee had died on the blotter and left a brown ring that looked like a halo for something that didn’t deserve one.

And there, under the cone of his desk lamp, lay the notebook.

The leather cover was scuffed at the corners, softened by years of being carried in a jacket pocket, slapped on bar tables, thumbed through in stakeouts. Ray didn’t need to see the name pressed into it to know whose it was. The notebook had a gravity to it. It belonged to Thomas “Tommy” Mercer—his partner, his loudest critic, the only man who could tell Ray he was wrong without getting his teeth rearranged.

Ray walked to it like a man crossing a room full of broken glass. Slow. Careful. As if the air might cut.

He laid his hand on the cover.

Leather, cold as a confession.

For a moment, he just breathed. Cigarette smoke clung to the walls; old case files gave off that dry, papery smell like dried blood. Rain seeped in under the window frame and mixed with the neon until the room looked like it was lit by sins.

“Real funny,” Ray muttered, because the only way to talk to the dead was to pretend they could hear you. “Leaving your book in my office like you’re gonna waltz back in and ask why I’ve got my feet on the desk.”

He found the strap, loose where it usually sat snug. That small detail—that it had been opened—pricked the back of his neck. Tommy was a creature of habits. He didn’t leave things sloppy unless something had forced his hand.

Ray flipped it open.

Tommy’s handwriting met him like a familiar punch: cramped, impatient, full of those sharp little angles that made every sentence look like it was ready to start a fight. The first page was a wash of names and numbers and little barbed comments in the margins.

Then a line near the top snagged Ray’s eye.

Camels. Lie about the ash-can. 3/12.

Ray barked a laugh that died halfway out of his throat. “You sentimental son of a—”

3/12 was their last case. The one that had stretched into the early hours and ended with a suspect who smelled like cheap cologne and fear swearing he didn’t smoke. Tommy had leaned on the desk and said, You wanna bet? And Ray—because he never backed down from Tommy’s stupid ten-cent wagers—had bet the man was lying.

Ray crossed to his desk drawer, pulled it open, and found the cigarette pack they’d taken off the suspect and kept, like a trophy from a small victory. He slid it out.

CAMELS.

He stared at it until his eyes ached.

That line could be nothing. Tommy had always written everything down—brands, street names, the particular tilt of a liar’s chin. He collected details the way some men collected debts.

Ray’s mouth twisted in a skeptical sneer anyway. Coincidence was the city’s favorite religion.

He turned a few pages.

Another entry, another date, another terse note. The rhythm was Tommy’s: facts, hunches, sarcasm. But then—halfway down a page—Ray saw a date that made his chest tighten.

February 22.

Tomorrow.

It wasn’t just the date. It was the ink. Darker. Fresher. The pen pressure dug into the paper like anger.

Two trains, midnight, Burnham Station.

Ray’s finger traced the words without him meaning it to, following the groove the pen had left behind. He felt the slight ridge in the paper. Felt how the letters leaned, just a degree different from the lines above.

“No,” he said softly, and the room swallowed it. “No, you don’t get to do that.”

He flipped back, forward, hunting for a joke, for a punchline. Tommy had a mean sense of humor. He’d once left a fake confession note in Ray’s hat and watched him nearly turn himself in.

But this wasn’t funny.

Ray bent close, inhaling.

Paper dust, familiar. Cigarettes, familiar. But the ink carried a faint, sharp scent that didn’t belong to Tommy’s usual pen. Like metal and solvent. Like something new.

Ray grabbed a pencil from the desk and began cross-referencing, scribbling dates on his blotter. Tommy’s entries had those little margin ticks, the ones he used when he wasn’t sure about something. They were there, consistent, almost comforting.

Except in the future lines.

Those had no ticks.

Those were certain.

Ray turned again, faster now, his grief changing shape—less weight, more edge. The notebook became a puzzle box, the kind that promised either treasure or a blade.

He found it near the back.

Mayor Devlin — 00:47.

Ray’s throat went dry.

Mayor Devlin was a name people said with their mouths careful. The kind of man who could buy a judge and still have enough left over for a new smile. Devlin had been “safe,” at least publicly. A man Ray had shaken hands with at charity events because it made the department look clean.

00:47.

Ray checked the clock on the wall. Its second hand ticked like a metronome for bad decisions.

Less than an hour.

A small part of Ray wanted to slam the notebook shut and throw it in the trash. Burn it. Scatter the ashes out the window into the wet night and let the city keep its time in straight lines.

Another part of him—the part that had walked into gunfire because Tommy was in there, the part that still set a second cup of coffee on the desk some nights before he remembered—leaned toward the ink like a man leaning toward a whisper.

Tommy had written this.

Or someone had written it as Tommy.

Or the world had gone mad.

Ray’s jaw clenched until it hurt.

“You wrote my name in here like you were planning on ghosting me,” he said, voice low, angry in the way grief got when it didn’t have anywhere else to go. “Real classy.”

He imagined Tommy’s grin, the one that always came before trouble. He imagined the coroner’s shrug, the word approximate floating above the sheet like a dirty prayer.

Ray shut the notebook with his palm flat, as if pinning down a living thing. The leather gave a soft, final sound.

“All right,” he breathed. “Fate or lead—whichever’s louder. Let’s see which one talks first.”

He slid the notebook into his coat pocket. It fit there like it had been made for it. He took the Camels, the lighter, the fedora off the hook. At the door, he hesitated, hand on the knob, and for a heartbeat he listened for footsteps behind him—Tommy’s stride, the familiar rasp of his voice.

Nothing.

Ray opened the door anyway.

Rain hit him in the face like the city’s version of mercy. The street below was washed clean, but the grime always came back. The neon still bled. Somewhere in the distance, a train horn sounded—lonely, warning, almost like a name.

Ray pulled his collar up and stepped into the night, feeling the notebook’s weight against his ribs.

Burnham Station.

Two trains.

And at 00:47, according to a dead man’s margins, the Mayor of Los Angeles would be somewhere he had no business being—unless he did.

Ray lit a cigarette, the flame trembling in the wet air.

He didn’t know if he was following a clue or being led by a ghost.

But either way, the city was about to find out what happened when you tried to argue with tomorrow.
